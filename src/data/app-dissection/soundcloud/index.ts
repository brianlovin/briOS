    "I use SoundCloud…a lot. As in, all the time, every day. I’ve been using it to [curate](http://www.mvsic.co/) new music for a few years now, and it’s been so fun to watch the platform evolve with each passing week. I admire SoundCloud’s ability to ship new features and improvements so often, striving to make the site faster and easier to use for everyone.\r\n\r\nThe SoundCloud team recently redesigned their iOS app – a surprising refresh of their mobile offering with a slick new listening interface and a beautiful new way of interacting with your music.\r\n\r\nSo far the reviews of the app have been overwhelmingly negative. The app currently sits at a 2.5 star rating on the App Store, and [some folks](http://blog.soundcloud.com/2014/06/26/the-new-soundcloud-iphone-app/) are diving [pretty deep](https://medium.com/@padschneider/the-new-soundcloud-app-sucks-bcbd77f0e8fd) into why the new app is a flop. The further I dig, the more it’s clear that this redesign was [intended for listeners](http://hypebot.com/hypebot/2014/06/soundcloud-throws-out-baby-with-bathwater-nice-app-design-but-musicians-feel-screwed.html), not for the musicians who represent the backbone of the service.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this post, I’m going to focus purely on the new interactions and design elements – not on the relative merits of the feature offering (or lack thereof) in the new app. I hope this works for everyone out there!",
