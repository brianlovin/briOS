    "Ah, Instagram. I’ll venture a guess that 99% of folks reading this have used Instagram at some point in their lives. It’s the app that changed the way we share photos with friends and followers and in a few short years has become a key tool in the app-arsenal of more than 300,000,000 people.\r\n\r\nInstagram is one of the most beautifully designed apps in the world. That’s my opinion, of course, although it would be quite the challenge to argue against the product’s unrelenting focus on keeping it simple. Other apps in the photos space emphasize features and technology while Instagram just gets out of the way and lets you enjoy great pictures.\r\n\r\nI had never really considered Instagram for a Design Details post for this exact reason: most of it is just obvious. Of course, obvious design is the hardest design, so that’s not a knock against the talented team working on Instagram (promise!). Instead, I mean that this feels like an app whose clarity and focus needs no further explanation.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I decided to investigate. Buried among Instagram’s streams of beautiful photos I’ve scoured up a solid handful of wonderful details that add a next-level layer of polish to the entire product. Enjoy!",
