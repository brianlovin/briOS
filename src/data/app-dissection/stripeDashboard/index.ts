    "[Stripe](https://stripe.com) is well known for their level of interaction polish and attention to detail. It's clear to see the amount of labor and love that goes into their products; from landing pages to mobile apps, everything they release seems to ignite a collective gasp within the design community.\r\n\r\n[Stripe Dashboard](https://stripe.com/dashboard/iphone) launched in the middle of last year with well-deserved recognition. It's a relatively simple app that can help business owners keep track of their customers and income on the go. The app doesn't offer nearly as much functionality as the web dashboard counterpart; intentionally, of course. It serves a clear purpose and executes on that purpose beautifully.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of my favorite design details from Stripe Dashboard on iOS.",
