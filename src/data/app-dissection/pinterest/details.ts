      "I’d love to start exploring more onboarding experiences for different apps. Onboarding and user activation is an incredibly nuanced and challenging problem for designers, and it’s an ever-evolving process to understand and improve the experience for people new to a product. I really appreciate what Pinterest does – both on their app and website – with their new user experience.\r\n\r\nThe focus here is entirely on benefits, not features. They don’t talk about pins, sharing, social media, et cetera. No – they talk about how people are using the app to solve real challenges or problems in their lives. The panning images here, accompanied by the simple value statements, make for a compelling (and intriguing) experience.",

What I wanted to really focus on here was what happens as you get past the header here – notice the way the text ‘Plants’ bounces into place. The fluidity here is amazing – it would have been so easy to have that text just…appear. But the motion here adds life and depth to the app that I think people out there will appreciate.\r\n\r\nEven when I start to scroll back up, the text bounces and scales away into the distance. Nice touch!",
