      "If you don’t use multiple Twitter accounts, it’s likely that you’ve never seen this interaction before. Pulling down on your profile pulls in the account switcher. I love the way the cover photo expands and blurs (a detail many other apps have begun to adopt).\r\n\r\nI’ve had to watch this detail several times to really catch everything going on. The playful bounces and the way the profiles ease into view makes using the app and switching profiles too much fun.",

      "When you’re on the account-switching view, you can simply pull down again to return to the top profile. This detail almost feels superflous, considering most people might just tap to go to another profile – but the attention to multiple UX habits and patterns here is respectable.",

      "If you’re not one to swipe and pull your way around the Twitter app, you can tap+hold on the Me tab in the bottom tab bar to open the account switcher. In this clip, I’ve also switched the accounts so you can see the way Twitter uses movement and spring physics to rebuild the interface for the newly-selected profile. Beautiful!",
