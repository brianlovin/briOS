    "It’s always big news when the Google machine unveils a new product. This week that something new is called [Inbox](http://www.google.com/inbox/), and it’s a slick rethinking of how we interact with and handle an ever-increasing volume of email.\r\n\r\n[Google’s Design Team](https://twitter.com/googledesign) has put in hard work these past months. Crafting the Material design language and rolling out interface updates across a suite of apps and operating systems is no small feat. Inbox embraces Material Design wholly, resulting in a beautiful, cohesive application for iOS, Android and web (Chrome only, for now).\r\n\r\nThis Design Details will explore some of the beautiful interactions in Inbox, as well as investigate a couple UX quirks that leave me wanting to learn more.",
