    "[Skype for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510?mt=8) released their 5.0 update for iOS last week. As a heavy Google+ Hangouts/Facetime user, Skype has been outside of my product radar for quite some time. Despite my lack of familiarity, Skype’s update shows an incredible amount of polish and attention to detail that designers out there will enjoy!",
