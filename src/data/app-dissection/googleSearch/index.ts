    "[Google Search for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-search/id284815942?mt=8) is one of those apps that doesn’t get much use on my phone, but has some really beautiful polish that designers out there will appreciate.\r\n\r\nGoogle designers, like [Noah Levin](https://twitter.com/nlevin) (who has been the sole designer on Google Search for iOS during the last three years), have been a huge inspiration in my own work in recent months. At the end of the day, this app represents a wonderful level of teamwork and collaboration between Google’s designers and world-class engineers who have built a simple, powerful and delightful app for us to use.",
