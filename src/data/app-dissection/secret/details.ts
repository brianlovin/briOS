      "When you first use Secret, the app guides you through many different interactions and walks you through all the different buttons and their meanings. Tapping on the ellipsis, next to the comments and hearts, brings up a window to hide or report that specific post.\r\n\r\nI found that this same window can be activated by swiping horizontally along the post, rather than tapping the ellipsis. I love how the post itself is blurred out in the process, helping you to focus on the current dialog.",

It’s a nice touch to have the activity view bounce lightly off the bottom of the screen, although it admittedly doesn’t feel quite natural – perhaps some easing tweaks here could help make the bounce feel more realistic.",
