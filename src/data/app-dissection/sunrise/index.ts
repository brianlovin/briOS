    "[Sunrise for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendar-for-icloud/id599114150?mt=8) recently replaced my stock iOS calendar app, and rightfully so. It’s a delightful piece of software that has so many neat little tricks – so many, in fact, that I’m sure this post will just scratch the surface.\r\n\r\n[Pierre Valade](https://twitter.com/pierrevalade) and [Jeremy Le Van](http://twitter.com/jeremylv), the designers of this gorgeous app, packed several beautiful details into Sunrise with the latest iOS7 update. I’ve only been using the app for a week at this point, so be sure to give me a shout if I’ve missed any of your favorite design details!",
