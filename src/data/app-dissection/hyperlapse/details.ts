      "What better way to onboard someone into a new app than to instantly share some of the beautiful creations they’ll be able to make? Hyperlapse nails this part, highlighting the function of the app in a concise and tasteful way.\r\n\r\nMy only negative note here is that the dots at the bottom of the screen (which indicate your current page) are really hard to see. I can imagine some folks getting stuck here waiting for something to happen without realizing they need to swipe left.\r\n\r\nAlso of note: pay attention to the rounded corners of the app, throughout. A very small and subtle touch (that admittedly looks much sharper against the bezel of the iPhone) which adds a tasteful splash of character.",

      "Blurring and springy physics (as we’ve come to expect from any Facebook-affiliated app) are a common thread that weave their way through the entirety of the Hyperlapse experience. Here, we initiate the app by giving permission to access the camera (which I’ve done prior to this recording).\r\n\r\nNote the responsiveness of the button to my touch, the way the video pauses and blurs, and of course, the way the tutorial tooltip springs into action.",

This change is a bit obscure; I’m not sure why the color is changing at all.",

      "Pay attention here to the times at the bottom of the screen. During my first run-through of the app I wasn’t quite sure what was going on down there. As I came to find out, the times represent the original recording time versus the post-processed video length (which defaults to 6x, hence the time change at the 0:06 mark).\r\n\r\nThis is another one of those obscure interaction designs that a user could only possibly know after using the app once or twice. For the first timer, the experience might be confusing.",

      "My apologies if these recordings make you dizzy – I tried my best!\r\n\r\nThis is actually one of my favorite details in Hyperlapse; it’s quite clever indeed. As you change the timelapse speed, a transparent black overlay flashes on the screen with stenciled-out text to show the current multiplier. This is a lovely touch, considering most users’ fingers will be covering the button itself.",

Pressing and holding on the video during the review process lets you quickly compare the stabilized vs. unstabilized versions.

It’s a smooth, seamless transition from one app view to another, and the motion here brings a certain playfulness to the product.",
