    "I must admit up front that I never hopped on board the Tumblr train during its meteoric rise these past few years. While I’ve taken a fair stab at setting up a few blogs, I could never quite get the app to stick with me in the same way that a personal WordPress site (or even Medium) has been able to do.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think Tumblr is one of the coolest apps in the world right now with world-class design and an extremely polished end-product. [The Tumblr website](https://www.tumblr.com/login) is a beautiful thing in and of itself, so be sure to check that out if you’re looking for web design inspiration.\r\n\r\nBut today’s post is all about Tumblr for iOS. At first glance I didn’t think I’d be able to find enough cleverness or creative patterns to compile a full post; I’ve come away pleasantly surprised and I’m excited to share this next chapter in the Design Details series with you!",
