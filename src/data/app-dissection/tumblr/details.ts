      "As you’re scrolling through your feed on Tumblr, tapping the ‘Home’ icon in the tab bar will, as expected, return you to the top of the view. What Tumblr does here though, that I’ve never seen on any other app, is toggle the ‘Home’ icon with a new ‘Return to position’ icon. Tapping once more will scroll you back down to your previous place in the feed.\r\n\r\nThis is amazing. I honestly wish other apps would do this already – Twitter, Facebook and Instagram all come to mind as places where I might accidentally tap to the top of the feed only to have lost my previous position.",

      "The springy animations that trigger when you tap the ‘Compose’ icon in the tab bar is great – it looks slick and provides some nice interactivity.\r\n\r\nWhat I thought was cool is that this view also responds to the accelerometer in the iPhone providing a subtle panning movement as you tilt the device. There’s not really much to say for this in the way of usability, but I appreciate the fact that there are people out there paying attention to these small things (even if most people might not notice).",

      "For some reason Tumblr lets you drag a blog’s profile picture around – similar to a Facebook chat head. I couldn’t quite figure out why this is supported, but hey – it’s fun, right?\r\n\r\nI also really appreciated some of the subtle scaling transitions that happen to the body layer whenever you expand/hide the profile photo. The obvious solution here might have been to just enlarge/shrink the profile picture on top of a static view. In this case, however, the view responds to the interaction and fades out+back or in+forward depending on the input.",

That curiosity may have turned into frustration if the attribution had been completely removed, but instead it turned into a feeling of safety and flexibility once I knew that I could restore it with a tap.",

It’s insane how fast they get users to content so that they can start favoriting, sharing, etc.\r\n\r\nAbout halfway through the video we see a nice tutorial view slide into view. That whole interaction is gorgeous, too – it’s unlike anything else I’ve seen in other app walkthroughs. I love the way it gently pushes the main view out of the way and back into the distance. The motion is buttery and builds up a certain feeling of trust and friendliness.",
