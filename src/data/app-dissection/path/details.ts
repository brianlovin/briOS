No extra fuss or unneeded messaging – just a few simple steps to get started, the modal fades away, then users are greeted with this simple interface and tooltip on the main share button. You can tell how much time the designers put into the small details here – especially the language on the tooltip.\r\n\r\nCreate a moment – this introduces new users to this process of sharing moments, not fluff. This isn’t where you share your latest score on Candy Crush, no – it’s a place to share moments with your friends. I like that.",

      " \r\nI remember when Path first came out – this popout sharing button captivated users and designers alike. I remember staring at the screen just asking how on Earth did they do this!? Path’s most recent update brings some minor changes to this design detail, but the feel remains very much the same.\r\n\r\nTapping the ‘+’ button opens a flyout menu of all the various types of content you can share on Path. The icons playfully bounce outwards, spinning simultaneously. Sure, it might take a bit longer to cycle through the animations here, but the added delight it provides new users is invaluable.",

These show up for new users when you first view a new tab, providing some context to that area of the app. This helps users become more familiar and comfortable with Path as a whole, a difficult task that any product designer out there understands and respects.\r\n\r\nAgain: don’t miss the subtle way the modal plays off the screen – it happens in a split second, but adds so much to the overall experience.",

As you begin scrolling down your profile, a few elements on the screen lightly fade away, gradually replaced by a simple header: “Me”\r\n\r\nBe sure to note the small touch here of having my cover photo display directly behind the iOS status bar – what a nice feeling to have your photo fill up the screen!",

      "There are two cool things to take note of on this view:\r\n\r\n - The back icon is Path’s signature ‘P’ logo. This is so cool to me – the most obvious answer here for any designer would be to include a simple ‘back’ or ‘close’ text line. But having the logo there (while maybe cognitively less obvious) adds some flavor and personality to the app.\r\n\r\n - Notice all the moving parts here as I spin the map around: The beautifully-designed compass twists so lightly as the text swirls in and out of view. It’s the small things like this, folks…",

As I tap the frosted-glass search bar in the main app view, a few filtering options bubble to the screen, inviting me to tap and explore. I’d really love to see the data here on how many users interact with the search suggestions on this view – it might say a lot about the current search solution on 99% of websites.",

      "Oh man, where to start with this view…\r\n\r\nI’d say the first thing to take note of is how the sharing button interacts when tapped. In this case, I’ve selected a quote to share – the quote icon scales up, fading simultaneously. It’s a really slick transition effect that I see more and more apps using recently (looking at you, Twitter!).\r\n\r\nOnce I land in the composer view, I toggled the ‘close circle’ and ‘private’ options – the context indicators that slide into view are quite beautiful. The motion here is super fluid, never skipping around or glitching unintentionally.",

I so clearly remember the first time I used Path, this detail totally blew me away – as you scroll through the newsfeed, a clock tooltip appears on the right side of the screen. Continuing to scroll adjusts the date and time dynamically based on which post is underneath it on the view. The hands of the clock spin so fluidly, and the date changes fade in without a hitch.\r\n\r\nIt’s worth downloading Path if only to learn from the pros about how to delight users with something so simple and clear.",
