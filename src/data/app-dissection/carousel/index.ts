    "I spent a long time trying to think of what app to cover for the next [Design Details](https://brianlovin.com/app-dissection) post. As of this writing, I’m approaching 400 installed apps on my phone – the search is getting harder.\r\n\r\nCarousel is one of those odd apps that slipped onto my phone when it first launched but I hadn’t returned to it for several months. Oddly enough, I had started to record a Design Details post when it first came out so I’m able to juxtapose a few design decisions that were made which have since been iterated upon and improved.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a Dropbox user, Carousel makes a lot of sense. It’s a wonderfully-focused photo storage and management app. Their iOS offering is beautifully constructed and has some wonderfully-refreshing onboarding design decisions. The Carousel web app is something you shouldn’t miss either – it’s a strong compliment to the mobile app and offers the Dropbox experience we’ve all grown to love right in the browser.\r\n\r\nCarousel, like all other Dropbox products, is fortunate to receive the art and branding love that can only come from designers as talented as Alice Lee and Ryan Putnam. The colors, lines and emotions conveyed in Carousel are warm and inviting – a safe place for your photos.\r\n\r\nAs we navigate through some of Carousel’s design details, it’s worth noting how crucial of a role animation and illustration play in creating a truly delightful experience.",
