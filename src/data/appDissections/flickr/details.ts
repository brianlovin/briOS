I think they’ll smooth this out in future versions, but even now it’s a very snappy, responsive interaction.',

      'Once upon a time Flickr was the host of high-quality, drool-worthy photos taken by professionals with DLSRs and high quality equipment. Those days have since passed, and Flickr is certainly working hard to stay with the times. The new camera is very sleek – simple, easy to use and certainly draws comparisons to VSCO or Instagram.\r\n\r\nThis gif shows the live-filters being added to the camera. I love the way the filters bounce in from the right side of the screen, and then stand up a bit taller on selection.',

It took me a while to explore this view and get comfortable knowing what options were at my disposal. In this case it seems like Flickr has buried some functionality that is quite fun to use – I’m not sure if the tradeoff makes much sense for an app of this nature.\r\n\r\nIn cases like these, however, I trust that the designers/engineers made the best decision possible with all available information.
