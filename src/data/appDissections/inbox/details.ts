      '[Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) is a visual language for interacting with digital interfaces. What we find in Inbox is a whole-hearted adoption of subtle motion and gestures to guide users through flows and views.\r\n\r\nThis splash page sets the tone perfectly for what users can expect in terms of interactivity, playfulness and speed. Every animation here feels paced and intentional, with the right level of stickiness and pop to each movement.',

I’m not quite sure how these suggested contacts are chosen – perhaps they’re people I email most frequently (hi mom and dad!) – this seems like an odd design choice in my opinion, as the odds of me wanting quick access to just one or two individuals is relatively low. On the odd-occasion where I do want to email these specific people though, I suppose the suggestion will be a nice shortcut.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth paying attention to the way Inbox plays with a semi-opaque white overlay in the view to provide contrast for the quick menu options. The animations here are nice and tight and don’t feel muddled at all.\r\n\r\nNote: Not a bad idea to slip the ‘invitation’ prompt there as well!

It flows less like a cohesive sentence and more like a series of headlines.',

Here we can quickly swipe an email to mark it as ‘done’ or to ‘snooze’ it for later.\r\n\r\nA quick digression: It’s quite interesting to see Inbox place so much emphasis on getting emails ‘done,’ i.e. treating your emails like a to-do list. At the same time, however, we have this idea of ‘pinning’ emails to your inbox. There’s sort of this clash of intentions here – do I pin an important email? Or do I snooze it? Or is a pinned item like a high-priority to-do list item? When do I unpin an email? Questions like these continue to arise the longer I dive into Inbox.',

At a glance I can know exactly where I’m located in the app.\r\n\r\nThat’s no easy feat to pull off as a designer – in fact, I’m struggling to think of any other apps that use color so prominently to create a sense of space and direction in a UI.',

      'I watched this video at least 20 times. I’m sitting here trying to wrap my head about some of the transitions here and what they mean for user experience and design in a general sense. Let me try to explain my line of thought:\r\n\r\nWhen I mark an item as done, or sweep some emails out of my inbox, the rest of the interface reacts accordingly and slides up quickly to fill the new void. This makes sense, of course. It fits our mental model of how these elements should behave in relation to one another. There is space and connection. With me?\r\n\r\nBut when I undo an action, the animation doesn’t just replay in reverse. No, the hidden elements snap sharply back into view and instantly readjust the page to accommodate for the extra objects.\r\n\r\nMy gut reaction was that this was simply a lack of polish – that the team had missed this step of keeping all the interface transitions smooth and consistent. But as I pondered more, I can’t help but think this was a very intentional decision by the Google team.\r\n\r\nAs a user, if I realize I’ve made a mistake, I want to undo that action as quickly and painlessly as possible. I want the interface to react accordingly – don’t waste a split second of my time before ensuring that my mistake was easily remedied. I think that’s what’s going on here: an undone action should be undoubtedly clear that it was complete and my information was restored. Simply reversing the transition makes me wonder if a) my information was never really gone at all or b) if I should wait for something else to happen on the page to ‘complete the undo.’\r\n\r\nI’m likely overthinking this, but would love anyone else’s feedback if they have thoughts on this UX quandary!',
