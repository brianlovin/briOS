They change depending on if you're swiping the card or tapping on the bottom buttons, which is odd considering they are functionally the same. My gut says the team is probably iterating towards a cleaner Tinder-style card where tapping and swiping will move the entire object in a consistent way.",

But it is *super* weird to be browsing random people's photos in this way - the best way to solve for this is to provide even just the smallest bit of context for why I'm seeing these people. \"2 miles away\" or \"Recommended\" or...anything, really...would help me feel safe and in control of my content. Instead, I'm suddenly concerned about if these people are seeing *my* photos.\r\n\r\nOne detail you'll notice deeper in the video: a longer swipe changes your message from 'like' to 'love' with a playful pop.",
