            Over the years domains and side projects accumulate. It takes mental
            overhead to keep things updated, running, and paid for. I’m going to
            start slowly integrating personal projects like Security Checklist
            into this codebase as a more future-proof way to tinker.

            So far, so good! The migration was painless (except for a few cases
            where outdated tutorials led me down the wrong path for CSS purging
            solutions). But here we are: as I slowly start to memorize the
            syntax, I feel like I have super powers.

            Are any designers out there making good passive income outside of
            your day job? What are you trying?
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            There were some really inspiring ideas in this thread about how to
            generate passive income as a designer. I didn’t realize there were
            real businesses being built on top of Figma plugins.
