            <p>
              Hey! I'm Brian, I'm a product designer at GitHub, startup founder,
              and side-project tinkerer. You can learn more about me{' '}

              or poke around the other pages on this site to get a feel for my
              work.
            </p>

            <h5>Why do I need this?</h5>
            <p>A product design health report will be most useful when:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Your product is about to ship, and you need a gut check to make
                things look great and work well.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your product has grown weeds, and isn‚Äôt quite as consistent or
                shiny as it used to be. You need someone to point out where to
                start fixing things and how to have the most impact with a few
                key changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                You want to understand why your designs seem to work well in
                Figma, but don‚Äôt end up looking correct in production code.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>How much does it cost?</h5>
            <p>
              $5,000 for a product teardown, which includes a user experience,
              user interface, visual, and interaction design audit, as well as a
              redesign of one view in your app.
            </p>

            <h5>Are you redesigning my whole product?</h5>
            <p>
              No. It takes a long time for a designer to ramp up in a new
              business, industry, and problem space. For that kind of long-term
              commitment, it‚Äôs probably better to hire a contractor or full-time
              designer. I will be spending my time evaluating the usability,
              interactions, interfaces, and workflows of your app, without
              requiring hours of your time to get me up to speed on the nuanced
              context of the product's entire footprint.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I won‚Äôt make up new features, remove features, or make
                impossible-to-implement changes to your overall app structure. I
                might suggest ways for features to flow better, or solve the
                problem in a different way, but I won't pretend to understand
                everything about your business or customer.
              </li>
              <li>
                I won‚Äôt redesign your logo, brand, or make other costly thematic
                changes (like color schemes and typefaces). I might gently
                recommend small tweaks in these areas, but your brand is your
                brand.
              </li>
              <li>
                This health report does not include a full accessibility audit.
                I will point out accessibility concerns as I encounter them, but
                this critique should not be used in place of a professional
                accessibility audit.
              </li>
              <li>
                I am unable to redesign your entire icon system. If you are
                interested in having help redoing your icons, I am happy to
                connect you with some of the best icon designers in the industry
                to do this work.
              </li>
              <li>
                I won‚Äôt implement any changes in code. See an{' '}

                for a more clear expectation of what you‚Äôll receive.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>What do you need from me?</h5>
            <p>
              Send me a list of 1-3 views, pages, or flows that need the most
              attention. If it's more helpful for me to see a realistic
              interface that your users will experience, you can create a test
              account with pre-populated data that I'll work against. For
              anything more specific, we can always hop on a call to make sure I
              understand your goals and situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will also spend time redesigning a single page of your product ‚Äî
              let me know which page I should use. It will save me time if you
              are able to provide your brand assets (logos, typefaces, colors,
              etc.), icon set, or other relevant documentation.
            </p>

            <h5>What's your refund policy?</h5>
            <p>
              I guarantee that we'll find a meaningful way to improve the design
              quality of your product, or I'll send your money back without a
              fuss.
